Broadcaster - a theme for Newscoop
==================================

Broadcaster is a theme for the [Newscoop](http://www.sourcefabric.org/en/newscoop/) content management system from [Sourcefabric](http://www.sourcefabric.org/). The design is by Pete Haughie, based on the [Rockstar](https://github.com/newscoop/theme-Rockstar) theme by Stephanie Miebach and Christian Kobben.

The distinctive feature of this theme is the integration with the [Airtime](http://www.sourcefabric.org/en/airtime) broadcast automation system. There are widgets for stream playback and display of the schedule fetched via the Airtime API from your broadcast station, as well as Article Types designed for a typical station with an article for each show in the schedule. The [Broadcaster theme demo](http://broadcaster.lab.sourcefabric.org/) site uses sample data from [Sourcefabric Radio](http://radio.sourcefabric.org/).

Like Newscoop, the 'Broadcaster' theme is &copy; Sourcefabric 2013 and released under the [GNU General Public License, version 3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html).

Please note that the 'Download this repository as a zip file' button on GitHub exports Newscoop theme files within a folder, whereas a working Newscoop theme should have its main template files in the zip file root.

How to install
==============

First, install Newscoop as shown in the [Newscoop user manual](http://sourcefabric.booktype.pro/newscoop-42-for-journalists-and-editors/system-requirements/). You do not need to install a sample site, as the dummy content is not required for production use.

The Newscoop administration interface includes a theme management and template editing tool, which you can find by clicking Configure on the main navigation menu, then Themes. A new theme can be added to Newscoop by clicking the **Import theme** button on the **Theme management** page. This action opens a dialog box which enables you to select a theme file from your computer. Click the **Browse button** to locate the theme's zip file, then click the **Import** button. Newscoop should report that the import was successful. The new theme should now be displayed in the table on the Theme management page.
